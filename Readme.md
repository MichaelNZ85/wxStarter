# wxWidgets Starter Project
A basic project for building wxWidgets apps. 

**Note: This project uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/), which must be installed and be on your Path for this setup to work.**

##Setup
1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a `build` directory in the main directory
`$ mkdir build`
3. Move into the `build` directory and run CMake:
`$ cmake ..`
4. Once CMake has finished running (assuming there were no errors), a Makefile should have been generated. Run it:
`$ make`
5. Once the build has succeeded, there should be an executable named `WxStarter` in the `build` folder. Run it and you should see a basic wxWidgets window!
`./WxStarter`
